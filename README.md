This Premium License is valid for one (1) person on an unlimited number of computers or devices operated by that one (1) person. If more than one (1) person in your company or household will be using our products, each person must purchase a separate license, or you must purchase a Corporate License to cover all company/household users.

Use Allowances and Restrictions (Premium License)
There are numerous allowances and restrictions that apply, determining how the licensed products (fonts and designs) can be used by You, relating to certain groups or categories of end product.
Digital Designs
Covered
Using fonts or alphabet products (such as embroidery alphabets or SVG alphabets) to create unique word, phrase, name, and quote designs, as long as the text from fonts has been converted to vector shapes and/or is rasterized or flattened so that anyone receiving the design no longer needs the font file itself in order to use and enjoy the design.
Covered
Using dingbats, doodles, extras, flourishes, or any other illustrated graphics as elements in a new digital design, as long as those illustrated elements are included as part of a font family, and are encoded into a font file format (OTF or TTF). These items included in font files are distinct from any other graphics, in that they are comparable to the characters in a font: they may be used as-is as part of a new digital design, but they must be one of many elements in the design, and cannot be used or re-sold as individual graphics in any way.
Covered/Limited
Modifying graphics, illustrations, clipart, or other design objects and combining them with other elements (graphics/text) to create a new and original transformative work, which can be sold as a digital design. See the Transformative Guidelines for examples of how purchased elements must be modified, combined, and transformed.
Covered/Limited
Using fonts to create educational resources that consist of the alphabet of a font, such as a “trace the letters” guide for children, as long as the design is flattened so that the font file itself is not included or embedded, and as long as there are other elements included in the overall design (such as illustrations and additional text) and the characters of the font are not presented in a manner or size that they could be easily separated, traced, or used to create new text designs.
Not Covered
Sending as-is or nearly as-is graphics, illustrations, or other design products to any outside printer, manufacturer, maker, or print-on-demand company, so that the outside person or company can make physical or digital end products on your behalf.
Not Covered
Using as-is or nearly as-is graphics, illustrations, clipart, or other design objects in a new digital design. See the Transformative Guidelines section below for guidance on how graphics would need to be modified, combined, and transformed for use in a new digital design.
Not Covered
Reselling, redistributing, or in any way giving fonts or alphabet products to any other person or party, or converting the characters from fonts or alphabet products (such as embroidery alphabets or SVG alphabets) into any other product which is made up of letters, numbers, or other characters, with the intent that buyers of that converted product could use the characters to create text designs of their own.

Web Font Use
Covered/Limited
Using a web font on a website owned and operated by the licensee, served from a site, cloud storage, or other online storage source operated and owned or rented by the licensee, up to a total of 100,000 page views per month. Web fonts must be used in a way that protects the files from access (such as hotlinking) and/or direct downloading by any third party from the source code of the viewer-facing website page which displays the text. For unlimited Web Font Use, please see our Corporate License.
Not Covered
Using a font on any website, or in any web-based app, program, or interface, which allows the end user to create text designs of their own. This includes templates at sites such as Templett or Corjl, where the customer fills in text fields with their own information using the font. In order to use fonts with template sites, or inside any text customization app, platform, or interface, please see our Corporate License.
Not Covered
Using a web font in any banner ad or other digital advertisement that is served on or from a website that is not owned and operated by the licensee.
